# economie-circulaire

The website [economiecirculaire.etalab.studio](https://economiecirculaire.etalab.studio/) has been developed as a tool to allow users to easily access open data related to circular economy.

The website provides an inventory section, `inventaire`, that uses the Airtable API to show data from an Airtable base.

There also is a form, `demande`, that is linked to another Airtable base.

This repo is based on https://github.com/abulte/dokku-simple-python-vue-spa.
